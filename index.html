                <p>
                    Three years ago, when I began at Broward College, I had no idea where life would take me. With three years of classes now under my belt,
                    I am excited and eager to utilize my passion and knowledge in a professional environment. To learn more about me, read my resume or click below.

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				
				<br>
				
				<h4>Finding Myself</h4>    
				<p>
					My name is Carlos Rossi. I am a student at Broward College pursuing a degree in Information Technology as well as a minor in Mathematics.
					I was born in the city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. However, when I was thirteen, my father accepted a job in Weston, Florida, and my young
					family was quickly uprooted. In Weston, my father, mother, younger sister, and I quite literally found ourselves in a foreing land with a
					foreing language. Since I was enrolled in english lessons back home it only took me roughly a year to become fluent in english. 
					
					We moved here around the start of summer vacation. So in those first couple of months before I met friends in school; 
					I stayed home and tinkered with my computer. Eventually this would lead to a cycle of completely ruining the PC and then finding ways
					to fix it. It was around my final year of highschool that I began to acquire an interest in software and its development. I enrolled in 
					AP Computer Science, my first programming class with Java as a language.  
				</p>
				
				<h4>Making Progress</h4>  
				<p>
					 I have always been intrigued and captivated by problem solving; so, after graduating from high school, I chose to persue a career in 
					 software engineering. Additionally I made a personal goal to complete a minor in mathematics. As a kid I dreamed of one day building or 
					 designing something I could call my own, now as an adult I see that I will do that through the development of software. My interest in 
					 problem solving that eventually led me to programming also made me gravitate towards mathematics. I am excited and eager to utilize my
					 passion and knowledge in a professional environment.

					Currently, I work as a mathematics tutor and as a full-time studen. When my tutor cap is on, I am responsible for assisting my student
					in understanding the material the view in class, devicing effective ways of testing those skills and helping them with homework.
					When I am a student, I have been able to maintain 3.0 GPA every semester; while I also enjoy getting involved in various
					on-campus organizations including the TALK CSE intership.
				</p>
				
				<h4>For The Future</h4>  
				<p>
					While I am still working towards my Associates of Science degree, I am eager to gain experience as a engineer in a software development
					related discipline. I hope to be challenged in a way that will allow me to develop my leadership and technical skills as well as communication
					abilities. I feel that by gaining these skills, I will be better able to succeed as a leader in my future professional career.
					I hope to work in a fast-paced, high-energy work environment after graduation.
